#
# Short note on generating suppressions:
#
# See the valgrind documentation for a description of suppressions.  The easiest
# way to generate a suppression expression is by using the valgrind
# --gen-suppressions option.  To do that you have to figure out how to run the
# test in question.
#
# If you do "test.py -v -g -s <suitename> then test.py will output most of what
# you need.  For example, if you are getting a valgrind error in the
# devices-mesh-dot11s-regression test suite, you can run:
#
#   ./test.py -v -g -s devices-mesh-dot11s-regression
#
# You should see in the verbose output something that looks like:
#
#   Synchronously execute valgrind --suppressions=/home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev/testpy.supp
#   --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=2 /home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev/build/debug/utils/ns3-dev-test-runner-debug
#   --suite=devices-mesh-dot11s-regression --basedir=/home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev
#   --tempdir=testpy-output/2010-01-12-22-47-50-CUT
#   --out=testpy-output/2010-01-12-22-47-50-CUT/devices-mesh-dot11s-regression.xml
#
# You need to pull out the useful pieces, and so could run the following to
# reproduce your error:
#
#   valgrind --suppressions=/home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev/testpy.supp
#   --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=2 /home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev/build/debug/utils/ns3-dev-test-runner-debug
#   --suite=devices-mesh-dot11s-regression --basedir=/home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev
#   --tempdir=testpy-output
#
# Hint: Use the first part of the command as is, and point the "tempdir" to
# somewhere real.  You don't need to specify an "out" file.
#
# When you run the above command you should see your valgrind error.  The
# suppression expression(s) can be generated by adding the --gen-suppressions=yes
# option to valgrind.  Use something like:
#
#   valgrind --gen-suppressions=yes --suppressions=/home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev/testpy.supp
#   --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=2 /home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev/build/debug/utils/ns3-dev-test-runner-debug
#   --suite=devices-mesh-dot11s-regression --basedir=/home/craigdo/repos/ns-3-allinone-dev/ns-3-dev
#   --tempdir=testpy-output
#
# Now when valgrind detects an error it will ask:
#
#   ==27235== ---- Print suppression ? --- [Return/N/n/Y/y/C/c] ----
#
# to which you just enter 'y'<ret>.
#
# You will be provided with a suppression expression that looks something like
# the following:
#   {
#     <insert_a_suppression_name_here>
#     Memcheck:Addr8
#     fun:_ZN3ns36dot11s15HwmpProtocolMac8SendPreqESt6vectorINS0_6IePreqESaIS3_EE
#     fun:_ZN3ns36dot11s15HwmpProtocolMac10SendMyPreqEv
#     fun:_ZN3ns36dot11s15HwmpProtocolMac18RequestDestinationENS_12Mac48AddressEjj
#     ...
#     the rest of the stack frame
#     ...
#   }
#
# You need to add a supression name which will only be printed out by valgrind in
# verbose mode (but it needs to be there in any case).  The entire stack frame is
# shown to completely characterize the error, but in most cases you won't need
# all of that info.  For example, if you want to turn off all errors that happen
# when the function (fun:) is called, you can just delete the rest of the stack
# frame.  You can also use wildcards to make the mangled signatures more readable.
#
# I added the following to the testpy.supp file for this particular error:
#
#   {
#     Suppress invalid read size errors in SendPreq() when using HwmpProtocolMac
#     Memcheck:Addr8
#     fun:*HwmpProtocolMac*SendPreq*
#   }
#
# Now, when you run valgrind the error will be suppressed.

            # results file here as well since the test suite ran.  If we see a
            # return code of 2, this means that valgrind found an error (we asked
            # it to return 2 if it found a problem in run_job_synchronously) but
            # the suite ran to completion so there is a valid xml results file.
            # If the suite crashes under valgrind we will see some other error
            # return code (like 139).  If valgrind finds an illegal instruction or
            # some other strange problem, it will die with its own strange return
            # code (like 132).  However, if the test crashes by itself, not under
            # valgrind we will also see some other return code.
            #
            # If the return code is 0, 1, or 2, we have a valid xml file.  If we
            # get another return code, we have no xml and we can't really say what
            # happened -- maybe the TestSuite crashed, maybe valgrind crashed due
            # to an illegal instruction.  If we get something beside 0-2, we assume
            # a crash and fake up an xml entry.  After this is all done, we still
            # need to indicate a valgrind error somehow, so we fake up an xml entry
            # with a VALGR result.  Thus, in the case of a working TestSuite that
            # fails valgrind, we'll see the PASS entry for the working TestSuite
