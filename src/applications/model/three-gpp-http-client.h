/**
 * @ingroup applications
 * @defgroup http ThreeGppHttpClientServer
 *
 * This traffic generator simulates web browsing traffic using the Hypertext
 * Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It consists of one or more ThreeGppHttpClient
 * applications which connect to an ThreeGppHttpServer application. The client
 * models a web browser which requests web pages to the server. The server
 * is then responsible to serve the web pages as requested. Please refer to
 * ThreeGppHttpClientHelper and ThreeGppHttpServerHelper for usage instructions.
 *
 * Technically speaking, the client transmits *request objects* to demand a
 * service from the server. Depending on the type of request received, the
 * server transmits either:
 *   - a *main object*, i.e., the HTML file of the web page; or
 *   - an *embedded object*, e.g., an image referenced by the HTML file.
 *
 * A major portion of the traffic pattern is *reading time*, which does not
 * generate any traffic. Because of this, one may need to simulate a good
 * number of clients and/or sufficiently long simulation duration in order to
 * generate any significant traffic in the system.
 *
 * Many aspects of the traffic are randomly determined by ThreeGppHttpVariables.
 * These characteristics are based on a legacy 3GPP specification. The description
 * can be found in the following references:
 *   - 3GPP TR 25.892, "Feasibility Study for Orthogonal Frequency Division
 *         Multiplexing (OFDM) for UTRAN enhancement"
 *   - IEEE 802.16m, "Evaluation Methodology Document (EMD)",
 *     IEEE 802.16m-08/004r5, July 2008.
 *   - NGMN Alliance, "NGMN Radio Access Performance Evaluation Methodology",
 *     v1.0, January 2008.
 *   - 3GPP2-TSGC5, "HTTP, FTP and TCP models for 1xEV-DV simulations", 2001.

/**
 * @ingroup http
 * Model application which simulates the traffic of a web browser. This
 * application works in conjunction with an ThreeGppHttpServer application.
 *
 * In summary, the application works as follows.
 * 1. Upon start, it opens a connection to the destination web server
 *    (ThreeGppHttpServer).
 * 2. After the connection is established, the application immediately requests
 *    a *main object* from the server by sending a request packet.
 * 3. After receiving a main object (which can take some time if it consists of
 *    several packets), the application "parses" the main object.
 * 4. The parsing takes a short time (randomly determined) to determine the
 *    number of *embedded objects* (also randomly determined) in the web page.
 *    - If at least one embedded object is determined, the application requests
 *      the first embedded object from the server. The request for the next
 *      embedded object follows after the previous embedded object has been
 *      completely received.
 *    - If there is no more embedded object to request, the application enters
 *      the *reading time*.
 * 5. Reading time is a long delay (again, randomly determined) where the
 *    application does not induce any network traffic, thus simulating the user
 *    reading the downloaded web page.
 * 6. After the reading time is finished, the process repeats to step #2.
 *
 * The client models HTTP *persistent connection*, i.e., HTTP 1.1, where the
 * connection to the server is maintained and used for transmitting and receiving
 * all objects.
 *
 * Each request by default has a constant size of 350 bytes. A ThreeGppHttpHeader
 * is attached to each request packet. The header contains information
 * such as the content type requested (either main object or embedded object)
 * and the timestamp when the packet is transmitted (which will be used to
 * compute the delay and RTT of the packet).
