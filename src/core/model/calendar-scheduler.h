/**
 * \ingroup scheduler
 * \brief a calendar queue event scheduler
 *
 * This event scheduler is a direct implementation of the algorithm
 * known as a calendar queue, first published in 1988 in
 * ["Calendar Queues: A Fast O(1) Priority Queue Implementation for
 * the Simulation Event Set Problem" by Randy Brown][Brown]. There are many
 * refinements published later but this class implements
 * the original algorithm (to the best of my knowledge).
 *
 * [Brown]: https://doi.org/10.1145/63039.63045 "Brown"
 *
 * This class uses a vector of buckets; each bucket covers a uniform
 * time span.  The bucket index for an event with timestamp `ts` is
 * `(ts / m_width) % m_nBuckets`.  This class automatically adjusts
 * the number of buckets to keep the average occupancy around 2.
 * Buckets themselves are implemented as a `std::list<>`, and events are
 * kept sorted within the buckets.
 *
 * \par Time Complexity
 *
 * Operation    | Amortized %Time | Reason
 * :----------- | :-------------- | :-----
 * Insert()     | ~Constant       | Ordering within bucket; possible resize
 * IsEmpty()    | Constant        | Explicit queue size
 * PeekNext()   | ~Constant       | Search buckets
 * Remove()     | ~Constant       | Search within bucket; possible resize
 * RemoveNext() | ~Constant       | Search buckets; possible resize
 *
 * \par Memory Complexity
 *
 * Category  | Memory                           | Reason
 * :-------- | :------------------------------- | :-----
 * Overhead  | 2 x `sizeof (*)` + `size_t`<br/>(24 bytes) | `std::list`
 * Per Event | 2 x `sizeof (*)`                 | `std::list`
 *
 * \note
 * This queue is much slower than I expected (much slower than the
 * std::map queue) and this seems to be because the original resizing policy
 * is horribly bad.  This is most likely the reason why there have been
 * so many variations published which all slightly tweak the resizing
 * heuristics to obtain a better distribution of events across buckets.
 *
 * \note While inserion sort is not discussed in the original article, its
 * implementation appears to dramatically affect performance.
 * The default implementation sorts buckets in increasing (chronological)
 * order.  The alternative, sorting buckets in decreasing order,
 * was adopted in NS-2 because they observed that new events were
 * more likely to be later than already scheduled events.
 * In this case sorting buckets in reverse chronological order
 * reduces enqueue time.
