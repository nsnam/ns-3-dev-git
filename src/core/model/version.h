 * Version information is pulled from the local git repository during the build
 * process.  If a git repository is not found, the build system will search for
 * a file named version.cache under the src/core directory.  The version.cache
 * file must contain key/value pairs in the format key=value with one entry per
 * line. The build system will use the data pulled from the git repository, or
 * loaded from the version.cache file, to generate the file version-defines.h
 *
 * The build will fail if a local git repository is not present and
 * a version.cache file can not be found.

 * See CommandLine::PrintVersion() for an example on how to

 * build-version-example.cc illustrates using each of these functions.
