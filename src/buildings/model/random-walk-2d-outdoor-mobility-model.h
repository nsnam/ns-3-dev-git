 *
 * \brief 2D random walk mobility model which avoids buildings.
 *
 * This class reuses most of the code of RandomWalk2dMobilityModel,
 * but adds the awareness of buildings objects which are avoided
 * by moving users.
 * Each instance moves with a speed and direction chosen at random
 * with the user-provided random variables until
 * either a fixed distance has been walked or until a fixed amount
 * of time. If we hit one of the boundaries (specified by a rectangle)
 * of the model, we rebound on the boundary with a reflexive angle
 * and speed. If we hit one of the buildings, we rebound with a random
 * direction which makes sure that the next step does not enter the building.
 *
 * The default values for the random variable that describes the speed is
 * taken from Figure 1 in the paper:
 * Henderson, L.F., 1971. The statistics of crowd fluids. nature, 229(5284), p.381.
