 * a single DCF within a MAC stack. Each ns3::DcfState has a priority
 * implicitely associated with it (the priority is determined when the
 * ns3::DcfState is added to the DcfManager: the first DcfState to be
 * added gets the highest priority, the second, the second highest
 * priority, and so on.) which is used to handle "internal" collisions.

 * medium at the same time, the highest priority local DcfState wins
 * access to the medium and the other DcfState suffers a "internal"
