/**
 * \brief Handle packet fragmentation and retransmissions for QoS data frames as well
 * as MSDU aggregation (A-MSDU) and block ack sessions, for a given access class.
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * This class implements the packet fragmentation and retransmission policy for
 * QoS data frames. It uses the ns3::MacLow and ns3::ChannelAccessManager helper classes
 * to respectively send packets and decide when to send them. Packets are stored
 * in a ns3::WifiMacQueue until they can be sent.
 *
 * This queue contains packets for a particular access class.
 * Possibles access classes are:
 *   - AC_VO : voice, TID = 6,7
 *   - AC_VI : video, TID = 4,5
 *   - AC_BE : best-effort, TID = 0,3
 *   - AC_BK : background, TID = 1,2
 *
 * This class also implements block ack sessions and MSDU aggregation (A-MSDU).
 * If A-MSDU is enabled for that access class, it picks several packets from the
 * queue instead of a single one and sends the aggregated packet to ns3::MacLow.
 *
 * The fragmentation policy currently implemented uses a simple
 * threshold: any packet bigger than this threshold is fragmented
 * in fragments whose size is smaller than the threshold.
 *
 * The retransmission policy is also very simple: every packet is
 * retransmitted until it is either successfully transmitted or
 * it has been retransmitted up until the SSRC or SLRC thresholds.
 *
 * The RTS/CTS policy is similar to the fragmentation policy: when
 * a packet is bigger than a threshold, the RTS/CTS protocol is used.
