/**
 * \brief Model the error rate for different modulations.
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * A packet of interest (e.g., a packet can potentially be received by the MAC)
 * is divided into chunks. Each chunk is related to an start/end receiving event.
 * For each chunk, it calculates the ratio (SINR) between received power of packet
 * of interest and summation of noise and interfering power of all the other incoming
 * packets. Then, it will calculate the success rate of the chunk based on
 * BER of the modulation. The success reception rate of the packet is derived from
 * the success rate of all chunks.
 *
 * The 802.11b modulations:
 *    - 1 Mbps mode is based on DBPSK. BER is from equation 5.2-69 from John G. Proakis
 *      Digitial Communications, 2001 edition
 *    - 2 Mbps model is based on DQPSK. Equation 8 from "Tight bounds and accurate
 *      approximations for dqpsk transmission bit error rate", G. Ferrari and G.E. Corazza
 *      ELECTRONICS LETTERS, 40(20):1284-1285, September 2004
 *    - 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps are based on equations (18) and (17) from "Properties and
 *      performance of the ieee 802.11b complementarycode-key signal sets",
 *      Michael B. Pursley and Thomas C. Royster. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS,
 *      57(2):440-449, February 2009.
 *    - More detailed description and validation can be found in
