/**
 * \brief Constant OBSS PD algorithm
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * This constant OBSS_PD algorithm is a simple OBSS_PD algorithm which evaluates if a receiving
 * signal should be accepted or rejected based on a constant threshold.
 *
 * Once a HE-SIG-A has been received by the PHY, the ReceiveHeSigA method is
 * triggered. The algorithm then checks whether this is an OBSS frame by comparing its own BSS
 * color with the BSS color of the received preamble. If this is an OBSS frame, it compares the
 * received RSSI with its configured OBSS_PD level value. The PHY then gets reset to IDLE state
 * in case the received RSSI is lower than that constant OBSS PD level value, and is informed
 * about TX power restrictions that might be applied to the next transmission.
