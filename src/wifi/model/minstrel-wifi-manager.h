/**
 * \brief Implementation of Minstrel Rate Control Algorithm
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * Minstrel is a rate control algorithm implemented in MadWifi and Linux.
 * The basic principle is to probe the environment and adapt the rate
 * based on statistics collected on the probability of successful
 * transmission.  The algorithm adapts the rate to the highest rate
 * that it considers successful, and spends a fraction of its time
 * doing 'look around' by trying other rates.
 *
 * Minstrel is appropriate for non-HT/VHT/HE configurations; for HT/VHT/HE
 * (i.e. 802.11n/ac/ax), users should use MinstrelHtWifiManager instead.
 * Minstrel will error exit if the user tries to configure it with a
 * Wi-Fi MAC that has VhtSupported, HtSupported or HeSupported set.
 *
 * Some notes on this implementation follow.  The implementation has
 * been adapted to bring it closer to the Linux implementation.
 * For each rate, a new parameter samplesSkipped is added. This parameter
 * is intended to solve an issue regarding the sampling of low rates when
 * a high rate is working well, which leads to outdated statistics.
 * This change makes throughput a bit lower in simple, stable scenarios,
 * but may help in dynamic scenarios to react faster and more accurately
 * to changes.
 *
 * Related to the previous, the logic for deciding when to sample random
 * rates is as follows.  When a sample rate is deffered to the second MRR
 * chain stage, a new parameter (numSamplesDeferred) is increased. This
 * paramters is used (jointly with sampleCount) to compare current
 * sample count with the lookaround rate.
 *
 * Also related with sampling, another parameter sampleLimit is added.
 * This parameter limits the number of times a very low or very high
 * probability rate is sampled, avoiding to try a poorly working sample
 * rate too often.
 *
 * When updating the EWMA probability of a rate for the first time, it does
 * not apply EWMA but instead assigns the entire probability.
 * Since the EWMA probability is initialized to zero, this generates
 * a more accurate EWMA.
