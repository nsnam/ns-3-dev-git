/**
 * \brief Implementation of Minstrel-HT Rate Control Algorithm
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * Minstrel-HT is a rate adaptation mechanism for the 802.11n/ac/ax standards
 * based on Minstrel, and is based on the approach of probing the channel
 * to dynamically learn about working rates that can be supported.
 * Minstrel-HT is designed for high-latency devices that implement a
 * Multiple Rate Retry (MRR) chain. This kind of device does
 * not give feedback for every frame retransmission, but only when a frame
 * was correctly transmitted (an Ack is received) or a frame transmission
 * completely fails (all retransmission attempts fail).
 * The MRR chain is used to advise the hardware about which rate to use
 * when retransmitting a frame.
 *
 * Minstrel-HT adapts the MCS, channel width, number of streams, and
 * short guard interval (enabled or disabled).  For keeping statistics,
 * it arranges MCS in groups, where each group is defined by the
 * tuple (streams, GI, channel width).  There is a vector of all groups
 * supported by the PHY layer of the transmitter; for each group, the
 * capabilities and the estimated duration of its rates are maintained.
 *
 * Each station maintains a table of groups statistics. For each group, a flag
 * indicates if the group is supported by the station. Different stations
 * communicating with an AP can have different capabilities.
 *
 * Stats are updated per A-MPDU when receiving AmpduTxStatus. If the number
 * of successful or failed MPDUs is greater than zero (a BlockAck was
 * received), the rates are also updated.
 * If the number of successful and failed MPDUs is zero (BlockAck timeout),
 * then the rate selected is based on the MRR chain.
 *
 * On each update interval, it sets the maxThrRate, the secondmaxThrRate
 * and the maxProbRate for the MRR chain. These rates are only used when
 * an entire A-MPDU fails and is retried.
 *
 * Differently from legacy minstrel, sampling is not done based on
 * "lookaround ratio", but assuring all rates are sampled at least once
 * each interval. However, it samples less often the low rates and high
 * probability of error rates.
 *
 * When this rate control is configured but non-legacy modes are not supported,
 * Minstrel-HT uses legacy Minstrel (minstrel-wifi-manager) for rate control.
