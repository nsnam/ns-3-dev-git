%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% If problem with https push %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$ git remote show origin

$ git remote rm origin		## if a https link is attached, 

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:rahulg737/ns-3-dev-git.git	## adding ssh link

%% if still the error comes,
Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

First, ensure that the SSH agent is running and that your SSH key is added to the agent. You can check the running agents with the following command:
$$$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Then, add your SSH key to the agent:
$$$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Ensure that your SSH private key (id_rsa) has the correct permissions. The file should only be readable by your user, so set the permissions as follows:
$$$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

When you run git push, ensure that you are using the SSH URL for the remote repository. 
$$$ git remote add origin git@github.com:rahulg737/ns-3-dev-git.git	## adding ssh link

After performing these checks, try pushing to the remote repository again using the command:
$$$ git push -u origin prb-util
