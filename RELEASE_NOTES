- FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.4.1

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- (internet) The native TCP implementation has been refactored, for the 
  following improvements:  
    1) congestion control has been aligned with the Linux architecture, 
       to facilitate easier coding of new congestion control algorithms
        or porting implementations from the Linux kernel, 
    2) Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery algorithms, compliant to RFCs, are 
       shared by all TCP variants, unlike previous releases. 
    3) TCP Hybla and TCP HighSpeed variants have been added.

- (routing) The PrintRoutingTable* functions now print the following information
  each time they are called: 
    1) the node ID, 
    2) the global time, 
    3) the local time (allowing for future introduction of per-node clocks), 
    4) the routing protocol type

- (traffic control) A traffic control sublayer has been added with the aim of
  introducing an equivalent of the Linux Traffic +Control infrastructure into 
  ns-3. This layer sits in between the NetDevices (L2) and the network 
  protocol (e.g. IP). It is in charge of processing packets and performing 
  actions on them: scheduling, dropping, marking, policing, etc.  Initial
  support for flow control has been added to the PointToPointNetDevice;
  backward-compatible support for other device types is provided.

- (traffic control) A three band priority queue modelled after Linux
  pfifo_fast queueing discipline has been added.

- (traffic control) Adaptive RED extensions have been added to the RED model

- (wifi) A number of changes related to improving support for 802.11n/ac
  models have been introduced.
  1) Two rate controls compatible with High Throughput (HT) Wi-Fi modes
     (e.g. 802.11n/ac), Ideal and MinstrelHT, have been added  
  2) Support for multiple spatial streams (MIMO) using existing SISO
     error models
  3) The WiFi helper API for the WifiMac sublayer, and the configuration
     of HT modes and parameters, has been simplified
  4) Better support for backward compatibilty with legacy modes

- (wifi) 802.11g was made backward compatible with 802.11b networks

- (internet) L4 protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) can be demultiplexed 
  by IP according to the incoming interface. In other words, it is now 
  possible to use specialized L4 protocols according to the interface.

- (internet) Ipv6Address::IsAllHostsMulticast() is now deprecated. 
  FF02::3 is not in the official reserved IPv6 multicast address list.

- (internet) Ipv6Address::IsAll[Nodes,Routers]Multicast() now checks the 
  address scope beyond the simple link-local. Nodes are checked for 
  Interface-Local, Link-Local and Realm-Local, Routers for the above plus 
  Site-Local.

- (internet) Ipv6 routing protocols must now *not* forward packets to upper 
  layers unless for extremey specific cases. The Ipv6L3protocol handles 
  almost all the packets directed to the host.

- (internet) Ipv6 can now reject packets directed to an address not configured 
  on the interface they are received from (Strong End System Model, RFC 1222).

- (internet) UDP and Ipv6 RAW sockets can now join Ipv6 multicast groups.
  Incoming packets will be filtered according to if there's a socket listening 
  to that group. Source filtering is left to the application.

- (network) ns-3 is now capable of serializing cooked (SLL) headers. This is 
  used in DCE to allow the generation of pcap directly readable by wireshark.

- (internet) It is now possible to set custom values for RipNg Link Down 
  (standard is 16).

- (internet) permanent (static) NDISC entries can be created for IPv6

- (internet) IPv4 RIPv2 protocol model is now available.

- (spectrum) TvSpectrumTransmitter models added to create television 
  transmitter(s) that transmit PSD spectrums customized by attributes such 
  as modulation type, power, antenna type, channel frequency, etc.
- (wifi) Several model improvements have been made.  Access points now 
  establish BSSBasicRateSet for control frame transmissions.  PLCP header 
  and payload reception have been decoupled for improved PHY modeling
  accuracy.  RTS/CTS with A-MPDU is now fully supported, and 802.11n
  stations now support two-level aggregation.

Release 3.22
============

Availability
------------
This release is available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.22.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
This release has been tested on the following platforms:
- Fedora Core 21 (64 bit) with g++-4.9.2
- Ubuntu 14.10 (32 bit) with g++-4.9.1
- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) with g++-4.8.2
- Ubuntu 12.04.4 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- CentOS/RHEL 6.6 (64-bit) with g++-4.4.7
- OS X Yosemite 10.10 with Xcode 6.1.1 and clang-600.0.56
- FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.4.1

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- (wifi) Support for MPDU aggregation has been added to the wifi model, 
  as well as a number of related example programs.
- (wifi) Added two combined power and rate control mechanisms to the
  wifi module.  The new mechanisms, PARF and APARF, are the first in the
  wifi module to jointly control transmission power and data rate.  Two use 
  case examples (PowerAdaptationDistance and PowerAdaptationInterference) 
  and a test case have also been added.
- (lte) In previous releases of the LTE module, the bearer release
  functionality was only partially supported. As an enhancement, a
  complete release bearer procedure is now implemented, which can be
  invoked by calling the new helper method
  LteHelper::DeActivateDedicatedEpsBearer(). The related output can be
  seen through the stats collected at different layers like PDCP, RLC,
  MAC, PHY. To support this implementation, an example and test suite is
  added within the LTE module examples and tests folder.  
- (wave) Additional support has been added for WiFi-based vehicular networks, 
  including the channel-access coordination features of IEEE 1609.4 and a 
  comprehensive VANET routing example that includes a Basic Safety 
  Message (BSM) packet generator application and associated statistics 
  counters.  Together, these allow users to evaluate the performance effects 
  in a VANET of varying transmission and channel properties (e.g., packet 
  rate, message size, transmit power, propagation loss model, impact of 
  routing protocol traffic, etc.).
- (internet) It is now possible to print the Neighbor Cache (ARP and NDISC) 
  by using the RoutingProtocolHelper
- (stats) A new TimeProbe class has been added to hook the data collection 
  framework to traced values emitting Time objects
- (documentation) the callback function signatures for all TraceSources
  is documented in Doxygen
- (utils) print-introspected-doxygen.cc has had several enhancements;
  use -h to read the usage message for details.
- (core) TracedValue and TracedCallback function signatures are now documented,
  which required changing the TypeId::AddTraceSource API.

- FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.3

New user-visible features
-------------------------

- The LTE module now supports the transport of the S1-U, X2-U and X2-C
  interfaces over emulated links via the new helper class EmuEpcHelper.
- CommandLine can now provide a shorthand argument name for any
  Attribute.
- Implemented support for Frequency Reuse algorithms in LTE module, as the 
  outcome of GSoC 2014 project. 
  The project also includes several sub-features, such as:
   - implementation of Downlink Power Control
   - implementation of Uplink Power Control
   - new DL-CQI generation approach, which increases throughput if FR algorithms 
     are used
   - seven options of Frequency Reuse algorithms: LteFrNoOpAlgorithm, 
     LteFrHardAlgorithm, LteFrStrictAlgorithm, LteFrSoftAlgorithm, 
     LteFfrSoftAlgorithm, LteFfrEnhancedAlgorithm, LteFfrDistributedAlgorithm
   - updated RadioEnvironmentMapHelper. Now RadioEnvironmentMap can be generated 
     for Data or Control channel and for specified RbId, what is helpful when 
     using FR algorithms
- Added a CoDel queue model.  CoDel queues measure and control the queue
  traversal delay.  The ns-3 implementation is a port of the Linux 
  implementation.
- Added support for TCP timestamp and window scale options, and added
  ability to trace the TCP slow start threshold value.
- SimpleNetDevice and SimpleChannel (used for adding basic link effects
  for testing of higher-layer protocols) have been extended to support 
  the option of broadcast or PointToPoint link semantics.  The bandwidth
  and link delay can be constrained, and it uses an output queue.
- SimpleNetDevice and SimpleChannel can be installed in a node through 
  a new helper: SimpleNetDeviceHelper.
- Implemented new PacketSocketServer and PacketSocketClient applications.
  The primary use is in tests, to avoid using the ones from the 
  application module that also bring in a dependency on the internet module.

Release 3.19
=============

Availability
------------
This release is available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.19.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
These platforms have been tested; others may work also:
- Fedora Core 20 (32 bit) with g++-4.8.2
- Fedora Core 19 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.8.1
- Ubuntu 13.10 (64 bit) with g++-4.8.1
- Ubuntu 12.04.3 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3

- OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 with Xcode 5 and g++-4.2.1
- FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.3

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- Extension to UE measurements and improved handover algorithm models in LTE
  module, as the outcome of GSoC 2013 project. The project also includes several
  sub-features, such as:
   - implementation of System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1);
   - a new option for automatic UE attachment using Idle mode cell selection
     procedure;
   - improved configurability of UE measurements; and
   - two options of handover algorithms for enabling automatic handover trigger
     in LTE simulation: A2-A4-RSRQ and strongest cell (A3-RSRP).

- A new FixedRoomPositionAllocator has been added to the buildings
  module. It allows one to generate a random position uniformly
  distributed in the volume of a chosen room inside a chosen building.  

- A new attribute ns3::LteRlcAm::TxOpportunityForRetxAlwaysBigEnough
  allows to overcome the lack for re-segmentation in the RLC AM
  implementation by assuming that the size of a TxOpportunity is
  always big enough for the RLC AM PDU to be retransmitted.

- After some profiling, the code of LteMiErrorModel has been optimized
  for speed, resulting in a significantly lower execution time of the
  LTE model when used with the error model enabled.

- A new WiFi extension for vehicular simulation support is available in 
  the src/wave directory.  The current code represents an interim capability 
  to realize an IEEE 802.11p-compliant device, but without the WAVE 
  extensions (which are planned for a later patch).  The WaveNetDevice 
  modelled herein enforces that a WAVE-compliant physical layer (at 5.9 GHz)
  is selected, and does not require any association between devices (similar 
  to an adhoc WiFi MAC), but is otherwise similar (at this time) to a 
  WifiNetDevice.  WAVE capabililties of switching between control and 
  service channels, or using multiple radios, are not yet modelled.

- A new IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) model
  is available.  Using ns-3's naming convention, the acronym is expanded
  to SixLowPanNetDevice.   The SixLowPanNetDevice is able to act as a 
  shim between IPv6 and a NetDevice, compressing IPv6 headers according 
  to RFCs 4944 and 6262.  The SixLowPanNetDevice is meant to be used over 
  IEEE 802.15.4 NetDevices, but it can be used on other NetDevices as 
  well (see the manual for full details).  This model precedes the
  general availability of an 802.15.4 model, so must be run in conjunction
  with a wired NetDevice model for now, or with experimental versions of
  802.15.4 models.

- It is now possible to use Ipv6PacketInfoTag from UDP applications in the
  same way as with Ipv4PacketInfoTag. See Doxygen for current limitations in
  using Ipv[4,6]PacketInfoTag to set IP properties.
  
- Ipv[4,6]Interfaces not respecting the minimum MTU requirements (68 octects
  for IPv4 and 1280 octects for IPv6) will be automatically set as Down.
  
- IPv6 addresses and routing tables are printed in a more conventional way,
  closely matching the Linux "route -A inet6" command.

- Additional time units (Year, Day, Hour, Minute) were added to the time
  value class that represents simulation time; the largest unit prior to 
  this addition was Second.

- A new parallel scheduling algorithm based on null messages, a common 
  parallel DES scheduling algorithm, has been added.  The null message 
  scheduler has better scaling properties when running on some scenarios
  with large numbers of nodes since it does not require a global 
  communication.

Release 3.15
============

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.15.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
- Fedora Core 17 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.7.0
- Fedora Core 15 (64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Ubuntu 12.04 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3

- FreeBSD 8.2 (32 bit) with g++-4.2.1
- Cygwin 1.7.9-1 with g++-4.5.3

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- A new random variable base class called 'RandomVariableStream', has been
  introduced.  This base class derives from ns3::Object, unlike the current 
  'RandomVariable' class which is a special type of object in the ns-3 
  system to date.  By making this class derive from ns3::Object, it can be 
  handled with the Ptr class, can carry attributes, and can have its parameters
  and initial state saved in the config-store subsystem.  A new attribute
  called "Stream" has been introduced for this class, to allow users to
  better control the assignment of underlying pseudo-random sequences to
  the RandomVariableStream objects (bug 101).

----------
 - bug 101 - random variable initialization
 - bug 1256 - Unnecessary SND.NXT advance, missing ACK for Out of Order segments

This hotfix release contains a fix for the PyViz visualizer and makes it
easier to add PyViz support to examples; otherwise it is the same as the
ns-3.14 release.

Release 3.14
============

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.14.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.14 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Fedora Core 17 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.7.0
- Fedora Core 16 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Fedora Core 15 (64 bit) with g++-4.6.3
- Ubuntu 12.04 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.6.3

- FreeBSD 8.2 (32 bit) with g++-4.2.1
- Cygwin 1.7.9-1 with g++-4.5.3

New user-visible features
-------------------------
- Transport protocol implementations (TCP, UDP) have been refactored to
  support also IPv6 connections. Dual-stacked IPv6 sockets are implemented. 
  An IPv6 socket can accept an IPv4 connection, returning the sender's 
  address as an IPv4-mapped address (IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is not 
  implemented).
- The LTE code from the LENA project has been merged, bringing in a
  significant redesign of the LTE module as well as many new features.
- An antenna module is now included, which includes different
  radiation pattern models. See the corresponding new section of the
  ns-3 models library documentation for details.
- A new buildings module is introduced which allows to model the
  presence of buildings in a wireless network topology.  
- New propagation models (OkumuraHata, ITU-R P.1411, ITU-R P.1238)
  have been added
- The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) MANET routing protocol for IPv4 was added.
- A Random Early Detection (RED) queue model has been added.
- Ipv6RoutingHelper is now in-line with Ipv4RoutingHelper concerning the RT 
  print functions. Various minor changes were made in Ipv6RoutingProtocol and 
  derived classes to make this possible.
- New "SendIcmpv6Redirect" attribute (and getter/setter functions) to 
  Ipv6L3Protocol. The behavior is similar to Linux's conf "send_redirects",
  i.e., enable/disable the ICMPv6 Redirect sending.
- Longer and more descriptive names are used for error units in RateErrorModel
  class and queue mode in Queue class. Attributes in those classes are also
  changed for consistency. See API documentation for details.
- The netanim animator is now bundled with the release.

  class. These model can be used in conjunction with
  the frequency-dependent propagation loss model based on the
  SpectrumPropagationLossModel class already supported by
  SpectrumChannel. 

- Extend the attribute system extend the attribute system to store map
  container objects in addition to vector containers.  The ObjectMap
  and related classes are patterned after ObjectVector.

- Support for IPv4 fragmentation has been added.

- Significant performance improvement for AODV in dense mobile scenarios
  due to a fixed bug in RERR processing.

- WiFi traces that were named promiscuous are now renamed monitor, and
  a separate flag for setting the interface to promiscuous mode has been
  introduced.  This disambiguates monitor mode from promiscuous mode.

Release 3.11
===========

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.11.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.11 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Linux x86_64 Ubuntu 11.04
  - g++-4.5.2
- Linux i686 Ubuntu 11.04
  - g++-4.5.2, g++-4.4.5
- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 15
  - g++-4.6.0
- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 14

- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 10
  - g++-3.4.6, 4.0.4, 4.1.2, 4.2.4, 4.3.2, 4.4.0
- OS X Snow Leopard
  - g++-4.2.1 

New user-visible features
-------------------------

  - The build system has been modularized, and the source code reorganized,
    to allow for modular libraries instead of a single monolithic ns-3
    library.   User programs now link a number of smaller, per-module
    libraries depending on the dependencies expressed to the build system.  
    Source code is now being maintained in individual modules with
    consistent directory structures.

  - Python bindings have also been modularized, and the bindings are now
    generated into a 'ns' namespace instead of 'ns3' for the old
    (monolithic) bindings.  By default the bindings are now modular, with
    a backward compatibility layer for older programs.  

  - By default, example and test programs are disabled from the build.
    Users can enable them via the use of a waf command at configure time,
    or automatically through the use of a new .ns3rc file.

  - int64x64_t is a new type which allows portable and easy to write arithmetic
    calculations that require a high degree of fractional precision.

  - An interface to the Click Modular Router and an Ipv4ClickRouting
    class has been added, to allow a node to use Click for external routing.

  - An interface to an OpenFlow software implementation distribution has
    been added to allow the simulation of OpenFlow switches in ns-3.

  - ns-3 coding style requirements have been applied to the entire coding
    base, resulting in a large number of whitespace changes.  The coding 
    style has been automatically enforced by running a style checking 
    program (utils/check-style.py) that uses the uncrustify (v. 0.58)
    program to apply changes. 

  - Some documentation reorganization to split documentation between
    the ns-3 manual (primarily focusing on the ns-3 core) and a new 
    "model library" document has been started.

Release 3.10
===========

Availability
------------
This release is available from: 
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.10.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.10 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Linux i686 Ubuntu 10.10
  - g++-4.4.5
- Linux x86_64 Ubuntu 8.04.4
  - g++-3.4.6, g++-4.2.4

  - g++-4.4.4
- Linux x86_64 Fedora Core 10
  - g++-3.4.6, 4.0.4, 4.1.2, 4.2.4, 4.3.4, 4.4.0
- OS X Snow Leopard
  - g++-4.2.1 
- OS X powerpc Leopard 
  - g++-4.0, g++-4.2

New user-visible features
-------------------------

   - NS-3 PyViz, a live simulation visualizer, has been added.  The 
     visualizer interacts with a running simulation, such that it uses no
     trace files. It can be most useful for debugging purposes, i.e. to
     figure out if mobility models are what you expect, where packets are
     being dropped, etc. There is also a builtin interactive python console
     that can be used to debug the state of the running objects. Although
     it is mostly written in Python, it works both with Python and pure C++
     simulations.

   - Wi-Fi MAC high classes have been reorganised in attempt to
     consolidate shared functionality into a single class. This new
     class is RegularWifiMac, and it derives from the abstract
     WifiMac, and is parent of AdhocWifiMac, StaWifiMac, ApWifiMac,
     and MeshWifiInterfaceMac. The QoS and non-QoS class variants are
     no longer, with a RegularWifiMac attribute "QosSupported"
     allowing selection between these two modes of
     operation.

   - Support for IEEE 802.11g (specifically, rates with Modulation
     Class ERP-OFDM) has been added to the wifi module. The new
     WifiModes have names of the form ErpOfdmRatexxMbps, where xx is
     the rate in Mbps (one of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54), and a
     WifiPhyStandard enumeration WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211g has been
     added to allow configuration of a Wi-Fi STA supporting ERP-OFDM,
     HR/DSSS, and DSSS rates (which some call an "802.11b/g" station).

   - Two attributes were added to WaypointMobilityModel.  The first
     "LazyNotify" (default false), if enabled to true, will suppress
     course change notifications if there are no position updates.
     The second, "InitialPositionIsWaypoint" (default false), if enabled,
     will allow an initial call to SetPosition () (before any waypoints
     have been added) to be treated as the first waypoint.

   - Regression testing is now completely performed within test.py
     rather than a separate "./waf --regression" that consults
     reference traces in the ns-3.x-ref-traces directory.  In most
     cases, the example programs whose traces were included in 
     ns-3.x-ref-traces have a corresponding test called from the
     test.py program.  It is still possible to write trace-based
     regression tests but they are now called from the test.py
     program.

   - New BulkSendApplication sends data as fast as possible up to 
     MaxBytes or unlimited if MaxBytes is zero.  Think OnOff, but 
     without the "off" and without the variable data rate. This 
     application only works with SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET 
     sockets, for example TCP sockets and not UDP sockets.

   - Extensions to the energy models:  1) a new Rakhmatov Vrudhula 
     non-linear battery model, 2) additional support for modeling 
     energy consumption in WiFi devices, 3) an example for how to add 
     energy models to a WiFi-based simulation (in examples/energy/ 
     directory).

   - New methods to print IPv4 routing tables to an output stream.

   - A replacement implementation for TCP for IPv4.  TcpSocketBase
     now replaces TcpSocketImpl.  There are subclasses defined for
     TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and the original RFC793 without
     congestion control.

   - Energy support for UAN module and Li-Ion energy model.
     Now each network node can have an associated energy source
     from which it consumes energy. The user can specify a custom
     energy model for the underwater transducer, with default values
     set for WHOI acoustic transducer. Li-Ion battery model added
     into energy models folder.

   - Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol 
     is a proactive, table-driven routing protocol for MANETs 
     developed by Charles E. Perkins and Pravin Bhagwat in 1994. 
     This implementation is for IPv4 routing and was contributed 
     by ResilNets Research Group.

   - A novel model to simulate LTE networks has been added.  It focuses 
     mainly on modeling the E-UTRA part of the system, with a particular 
     attention on the aspects related to the channel, PHY and MAC layers. 
     The most important features available at this moment are (i) a basic 
     implementation of both the UE and the eNB devices, (ii) RRC and 
     entities for both the UE and the eNB, (iii) an Adaptive Modulation 
     and Coding (AMC) scheme for the downlink, (iv) the management of the 
     data radio bearers (with their QoS parameters), the MAC queues and 
     the RLC instances, (v) Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) management, 
     (vi) support for both uplink and downlik packet scheduling, 
     (vii) a PHY layer model with Resource Block level granularity, and 
     (viii) a channel model with the outdoor E-UTRAN propagation loss 
     model.

   - Project documentation has been converted from GNU Texinfo to Sphinx.

Release 3.9
===========

Availability
------------
This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.9.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.9 has been tested on the following platforms:
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32/64-bit gcc-4.4.3
- Fedora Core 12 64-bit gcc-4.4.3
- Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit gcc-4.4.1

- Windows Cygwin 1.7.5

Not all ns-3 options are available on all platforms; consult the
wiki for more information:
http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation

New user-visible features
-------------------------

   - A reorganisation of the construction of Wi-Fi transmit rates has
     been undertaken with the aim of simplifying the task of
     supporting further IEEE 802.11 PHYs. This work has been completed
     under the auspices of Bug 871. A consequence of this work is that
     WifiModes have a new (hopefully future-proof) naming, and
     simulations which specify rates by name will need updating. The
     list of new rate names is given in the error message produced
     when an attempt is made to use any invalid rate name (including
     those that were previously valid).

   - A new OFDM error rate model for WiFi (NistErrorRateModel); this model
     has been validated in clear-channel testbed tests.  For 802.11b, it
     uses the same underlying model as the YansErrorRateModel, but it differs
     from YansErrorRateModel for OFDM modes (802.11a/g).  The default
     YansWifiPhyHelper has been changed to use this model.

   - A new NS-2 mobility trace reader supports BonnMotion, SUMO, TraNS, 
     etc. traces.

   - An energy model for nodes and devices, including an energy source
     model and device energy models allowing energy-aware devices
     to notify the energy source about energy consumption.  

   - Rocketfuel topology dataset support for existing topology reader
     Rocketfuel project: 
     http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel/

   - Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) model, split in to three parts, the 
     channel, PHY, and MAC models to enable researchers to model a variety 
     of underwater network scenarios.

   - the Spectrum framework, which provides support for spectrum-aware
     Channel and PHY layer modeling. It features a set of classes that
     allows the mathematical representation of frequency dependent
     phenomena. Some example channel, propagation and device
     implementations that make use of this framework are also
     included.

http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.8.tar.bz2

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.8 has been tested on the following platforms:
  - linux x86 gcc 4.4.0, 4.3.2, 4.2, 4.1.1, 4.1 and 3.4.6 (debug and optimized)
  - linux x86_64 gcc 4.4.0, 4.3.2, 4.2.4, 4.2.3, 4.2.1, 4.1.3, 3.4.6 (debug and optimized)
  - MacOS X ppc gcc 4.0.x and 4.2.x (debug and optimized)

Not all ns-3 options are available on all platforms; consult the
wiki for more information:
http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation

New user-visible features
-------------------------
  a) WiMAX net device: Allow to simulated IEEE 802.16 point to multi-point based networks 

  b) Distributed simulation for point-to-point networks using the Message 
     Passing Interface (MPI) standard.
    
  c) Matrix propagation loss model uses a two-dimensional matrix of path loss indexed 
     by source and destination nodes.

  d) Topology read system: Allows quick and easy creation of large topologies by reading 
     Inet or Orbis files

  e) Gauss-Markov mobility model: Adds 3-d adaptation of Gauss-Markov mobility model which 
     has both memory and variability

  f) Steady-state random waypoint mobility model: Based on random waypoint mobility (RWM) model for case when 
     speed, pause and position are uniformly distributed random variables. However, initial values of these 
     parameters are not from uniform distribution but from stationary distribution of RWM model.

  g) Two-ray ground propagation loss model: Calculates the crossover distance under which Friis is used. 
     The antenna height is set to the nodes z coordinate, but can be added to using the model parameter 
     SetHeightAboveZ, which will affect ALL stations

     destination address should be accepted as one of the host's own 
     addresses.  

  i) UniformDiscPositionAllocator added; distributes uniformly the nodes 
     within a disc of given radius. 

  j) ChannelNumber attribute added to YansWifiPhy. Now it is possible to 
     setup wifi channel using WifiPhyHelper::Set() method.

    wall-clock time (contributed by Craig Dowell).

  d) Network Simulation Cradle
    It is now possible to use the Network Simulation Cradle 
    (http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2/nsc/) in ns-3 and run simulations 
    using various versions of kernel TCP network stacks. (contributed
    by Florian Westphal as part of his Google Summer of Code work)

  e) A statistics framework
    Joseph Kopena contributed a statistics framework which can be used
    keep track of simulation data in persistent storage across multiple

========================

The first ns-3 stable release
-----------------------------

This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-3.1.tar.bz2

We dedicate this initial ns-3 release to our late contributor and friend, 
Federico Maguolo.

What is ns-3 ?
--------------

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and 
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility 
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which 
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties. 
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported 
models and/or to maintain existing models.

Release 3.0.13 (2008/06/02)
===========================
- point to point links generate ppp pcap traces
- point to point links support asymmetrical data rates.
- generate doxygen documentation for all attributes and trace sources
- add ConfigStore and GtkConfigStore to contrib module
- socket API now support tx and rx buffers: implemented for UDP and TCP
- ARP cache now supports per-entry pending queues
- lots of bugfixes and implementation and API cleanups

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.  

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is 
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.
