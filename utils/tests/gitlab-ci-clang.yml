# NS3 CI script for CLANG

# Any scheduled pipeline for CLANG should define a variable, named
# "RELEASE", that has a value "weekly". Also, a variable "CLANG" should be set
# to True.

# We support CLANG 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# We test only CLANG 6 and 10 on Ubuntu 18.04, and 11 and 14 on Ubuntu 22.04
# The test is done under Linux.
