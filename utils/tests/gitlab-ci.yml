# NS3 CI script

# For naming purposes, we will prepend ".base-" on the jobs
# that are not complete and need to be extended (hopefully
# we write in the documentation before the job what should be
# added to have a working jobs).

# As per Gitlab documentation, extends supports multi-level inheritance,
# however it is not recommended to use more than three levels.


# Any scheduled pipeline should define a variable, named "RELEASE", that
# indicates what this script is run for. Allowed values, for the moment,
# are "daily" and "weekly" to denote a daily (or weekly) job.

# Our configuration is not strictly sequential, or by using different
# words, we do not expect the CI infrastructure to run build, test, and
# documentation jobs each time that a commit is done. We use a different
# configuration, still in definition. It will be in the documentation.


stages:
  - build
  - test
  - documentation
